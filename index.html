<h1>TDD Workshop</h1>

<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>
In this workshop, we'll help you make your first steps with Test Driven Development in Rails, using RSpec. RSpec is a widely used testing framework that can be used un pure ruby and also
have helpers for Rails and other web developement frameworks.
</p>

<p>
We will start with an already existing application just to get started and learn about how to write a test, the different types of tests, good practices. Then, once we added some different tests,
we'll develop a new feature using Test Driven Development.
</p>

<h2>Install rvm</h2>

<a href=https://rvm.io/>https://rvm.io/</a><br>

<tt>\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable</tt>

<p>
  `RVM` is a Ruby version manager. There are many others, like `rbenv` and `asdf`. It is useful when you have multiple Ruby applications on your computer, using different ruby
  versions. You don't have to install RVM if you already have a version manager.
