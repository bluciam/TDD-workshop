<h1>TDD Workshop</h1>

<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>
In this workshop, we'll help you make your first steps with Test Driven Development in Rails, using RSpec. RSpec is a widely used testing framework that can be used un pure ruby and also
have helpers for Rails and other web developement frameworks.
</p>

<p>
We will start with an already existing application just to get started and learn about how to write a test, the different types of tests, good practices. Then, once we added some different tests,
we'll develop a new feature using Test Driven Development.
